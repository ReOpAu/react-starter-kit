## Rule Improvement Triggers

- New code patterns not covered by existing rules
- Repeated similar implementations across files
- Common error patterns that could be prevented
- New libraries or tools being used consistently
- Emerging best practices in the codebase

# Analysis Process:
- Compare new code with existing rules
- Identify patterns that should be standardized
- Look for references to external documentation
- Check for consistent error handling patterns
- Monitor test patterns and coverage

# Rule Updates:

- **Add New Rules When:**
  - A new technology/pattern is used in 3+ files
  - Common bugs could be prevented by a rule
  - Code reviews repeatedly mention the same feedback
  - New security or performance patterns emerge

- **Modify Existing Rules When:**
  - Better examples exist in the codebase
  - Additional edge cases are discovered
  - Related rules have been updated
  - Implementation details have changed

- **Example Pattern Recognition:**

  ```typescript
  // If you see repeated patterns like:
  const data = await prisma.user.findMany({
    select: { id: true, email: true },
    where: { status: 'ACTIVE' }
  });

  // Consider adding to [prisma.mdc](mdc:shipixen/.cursor/rules/prisma.mdc):
  // - Standard select fields
  // - Common where conditions
  // - Performance optimization patterns
  ```

  ```typescript
  // If you see hook patterns like:
  export function useMyHook() {
    const [state, setState] = useState();
    const log = (...args) => console.log(...args); // ❌ Unstable
    
    useEffect(() => {
      doSomething();
    }, [setState]); // ❌ Setter in dependencies
  }

  // Consider enforcing via [hook-architecture-patterns.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/hook-architecture-patterns.mdc):
  // - Stable logging patterns
  // - Infinite loop prevention
  // - Clean dependency management
  ```

- **Rule Quality Checks:**
- Rules should be actionable and specific
- Examples should come from actual code
- References should be up to date
- Patterns should be consistently enforced

## Continuous Improvement:

- Monitor code review comments
- Track common development questions
- Update rules after major refactors
- Add links to relevant documentation
- Cross-reference related rules

## Rule Deprecation

- Mark outdated patterns as deprecated
- Remove rules that no longer apply
- Update references to deprecated rules
- Document migration paths for old patterns

## Documentation Updates:

- Keep examples synchronized with code
- Update references to external docs
- Maintain links between related rules
- Document breaking changes

Follow [cursor-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/cursor-rules.mdc) for proper rule formatting and structure.

# Self-Improve Protocol

- Add/modify rules when new patterns, bugs, or best practices emerge.
- Update rules after major refactors or repeated feedback.
- Remove outdated rules.
- Keep examples and references up to date.
