# Documentation Update Protocol

- Always ask user before:
  - Adding/updating docs, rules, or examples
  - Changing state management or architecture
  - Modifying Cursor Rules or enforcement patterns
- Never delete or change docs/rules without explicit approval.

- Document the need to run `npx convex dev` after backend file changes that affect Convex actions, so that API types are regenerated for the frontend.

- [ ] When a new architectural pattern is established (e.g., unified selection hydration), update both documentation and Cursor Rules to reflect it.
