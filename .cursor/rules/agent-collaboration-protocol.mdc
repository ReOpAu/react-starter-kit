# AI Agent Collaboration Protocol

- Always cite relevant project rules/docs before answering.
- Ground solutions in cited rules.
- Never explain general software concepts—only apply project patterns.

- Always consider the full system (UI, backend, APIs, external services).
- Provide all steps for changes, including external config.
- Diagnose errors holistically (not just client-side).

- Use project-specific terms.
- Connect changes to documented goals.
- Never give generic best practices.
