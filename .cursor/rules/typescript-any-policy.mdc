# No Explicit `any` Types

- Never use the `any` type in application code.
- Use `unknown` and type guards for dynamic data.
- For third-party APIs (e.g., window.google), use `(window as any)` only with a comment explaining the necessity.
- All new code must pass the linter rule: `typescript/noExplicitAny`.

## Example

```typescript
// Good
const foo: unknown = getDynamicData();
if (typeof foo === 'string') {
  // ...
}

// Acceptable (with comment)
const google = (window as any).google; // Required for Google Maps interop

// Bad
const foo: any = getDynamicData();
```
```

## 4. **Automated Fix for Existing Code**

- Run biome or eslint with --fix to auto-fix some cases.
- For remaining any, do a global search for : any and manually refactor or add type assertions with comments.

---

## 5. **CI Enforcement**

- Ensure your CI pipeline runs biome or eslint and fails on any new any usage.
