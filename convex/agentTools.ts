/**
 * Agent Tools Registry
 * 
 * This file serves as a registry for agent-facing Convex mutations and queries.
 * All client tools are actually implemented in useAddressFinderClientTools.ts.
 * 
 * Note: Currently all agent interactions use client-side tools defined in
 * app/elevenlabs/hooks/useAddressFinderClientTools.ts. This file is reserved
 * for future server-side agent tools if needed.

// No active agent tools - all functionality is implemented via client tools
// See: app/elevenlabs/hooks/useAddressFinderClientTools.ts for the 12 active client tools
