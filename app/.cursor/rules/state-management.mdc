## Map Display for Validated Selections (Rule)
- Only display maps for confirmed selections with validated coordinates (`lat`/`lng`).
- After validation, always enrich the confirmed selection with these fields if available.
- Never display a map for partial or unvalidated suggestions.
- The `Suggestion` type includes optional `lat` and `lng` fields for this purpose.
- Example: See SelectedResultCard and useActionHandler for implementation.
